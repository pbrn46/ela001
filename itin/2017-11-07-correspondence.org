** DONE =return= statement
   CLOSED: [2017-11-07 Tue 11:40]
The =return= statement will actually quit the function, and as a side effect
quit looping too, since the loop is inside the function

That's why, during your for loop as you are checking it, you actually _need_ to
check all of the items before you know that they all are not equal.

If the =return false= is inside the for loop, you are saying "For every item,
check if any is true. If it is, then tell me. If it isn't, *tell me it's not but
don't keep checking the next one*."
